## Detailed Description

IoTHubClient_LL is a module that allows a user (usually a device) to communicate with an Azure IoTHub. It can send events and receive messages. At any given moment in time there can only be at most 1 message callback function.

This API surface contains a set of APIs that allows the user to interact with the lower layer portion of the IoTHubClient. These APIs contain _LL_ in their name, but retain the same functionality like the IoTHubClient_... APIs, with one difference. If the _LL_ APIs are used then the user is responsible for scheduling when the actual work done by the IoTHubClient happens (when the data is sent/received on/from the wire). This is useful for constrained devices where spinning a separate thread is often not desired.
